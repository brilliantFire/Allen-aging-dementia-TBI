# Allen-aging-dementia-TBI
Repo for loading and analyzing the data from the Allen Institute of Brain Science's [Aging, Dementia, &amp; TBI Study](http://aging.brain-map.org/). Inputs and outputs of scripts in `ETL` and `EDA` are stored in `data`. The `work` folder contains things currently being worked on.  

The `blog-notebooks` folder has some Jupyter notebooks I made in the process of blogging about this project. See [my Jekyll blog](http://blog.vislaywade.com/).  

This project is being used to fulfill the requirements of the Master's in Predictive Analytics program from Northwestern University.  Thanks for checking it out.
