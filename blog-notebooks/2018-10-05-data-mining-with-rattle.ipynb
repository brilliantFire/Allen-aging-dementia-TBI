One of the best things about these tools is that a lot of them are open-source and available for free (you can find a list of some of those [here](https://opensourceforu.com/2017/03/top-10-open-source-data-mining-tools/).  \n",

    "`Rattle` makes an initial guess at data types and variable purposes (input, target, etc.). If we wanted to recode any variables as a different type (i.e. make a numeric variable into a categorical one or vice versa), we can do that on the Transform tab. We can change the variable purposes in the Data tab. For example, `Rattle` makes the last column in the table the Target variable. In this case, the last column is the `nia_reagan` variable, which encodes a pathological Alzheimer's diagnosis of the patient made post-mortem [according to a specific set of criteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9330978). We want to make the Target `act_demented`, which takes the values \"Dementia\" or \"No Dementia\". To do this, we use the buttons to make `nia_reagan` an Input variable and `act_demented` the Target. Then we press Execute again.  \n",
